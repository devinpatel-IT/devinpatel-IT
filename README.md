I'm an IT professional with hands-on experience in system administration, networking, cloud infrastructure (Azure), and cybersecurity fundamentals. This GitHub portfolio showcases my technical projects ‚Äî from configuring Active Directory environments, Ticketing Systems, deploying cross-platform virtual machines in the cloud, and analyzing network traffic with tools like Wireshark.

Each project here is designed to demonstrate my practical skills, attention to detail, and ability to work across Windows, Linux, and cloud-based systems.
I'm passionate about building secure, efficient, and well-documented environments that reflect real-world enterprise scenarios.

Feel free to explore my repositories ‚Äî and thanks for visiting!
